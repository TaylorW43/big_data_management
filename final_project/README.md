# Project 2: Implementing Local Outlier Detection (LOF) on Hadoop or Spark
In anomaly detection, the local outlier factor (LOF) is an algorithm for finding anomalous data points by measuring the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. The algorithm is suitable for detecting the outliers even if the data space has many areas with different densities as illustrated in the figure.


LOF is a centralized algorithm, i.e., runs on a single machine. There are some attempts to make it distributed (slides available)
